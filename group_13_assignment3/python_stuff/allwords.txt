the
wisest
of
men
resolved
to
build
a
temple
dedicated
to
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
he
remembered
the
sacred
words
of
scripture
and
if
thou
make
me
an
altar
of
stone
thou
shalt
not
build
it
of
hewn

the
tools
of
iron
symbolized
the
sword
the
instrument
of
war
and
death
whilst
the
altar
and
temple
were
the
symbols
of
peace
and
life
solomon
desired
that
not
only
the
altar
but
all
the
stonework
in
the
sacred
edifice
should
be
made
ready
for
the
builders
at
the
quarry
without
using
any
metal
implement
so
that
in
the
course
of
building
the
temple
no
instrument
of
iron
should
be
employed
how
was
this
wish
to
be
realized
even
solomon
the
wisest
of
monarchs
did
not
know
how
to
set
about
his
task
again
and
again
he
asked
himself
how
is
it
possible
to
split
the
immense
blocks
of
stone
or
to
cut
down
the
huge
trees
if
the
workmen
are
not
allowed
to
use
metal
implements
in
despair
the
king
summoned
his
great
council
of
state
consisting
of
the
wisest
men
in
his
kingdom
he
told
them
his
difficulty
and
asked
them
if
they
could
help
him
to
achieve
his
purpose
the
counsellors
listened
to
the
words
of
their
beloved
monarch
in
profound
silence
after
a
while
one
of
the
most
venerable
of
those
present
arose
and
turning
to
the
king
spake
as
follows
long
live
the
king
mighty
sovereign
hast
thou
not
heard
that
among
the
countless
creatures
of
the
most
high
there
is
one
which
can
serve
thee
as
thy
heart
desires
it
can
cut
stone
better
than
the
sharpest
tool
of
iron
i
refer
to
the
tiny
but
wonderful
worm
called
the
shamir
or
diamond
insect
dost
thou
not
know
o
wisest
of
rulers
how
the
almighty
created
ten
marvels
in
the
twilight
of
the
eve
of
the
first
sabbath
in
the
week
of
creation
among
these
marvels
was
the
worm
shamir
its
size
is
that
of
a
grain
of
barley
it
is
endowed
with
miraculous
power
for
behold
it
can
split
the
hardest
stone
by
merely
touching
it
moreover
iron
is
broken
by
its
mere
presence
excellent
wisdom
is
this
which
thou
shewest
forth
beloved
counsellor
cried
solomon
with
joy
in
his
heart
now
tell
me
where
is
this
marvellous
little
worm
to
be
found
may
thy
days
be
as
glorious
as
the
days
of
david
thy
father
replied
the
wise
servant
of
the
king
but
more
than
i
have
already
told
thee
i
know
not
no
mortal
being
has
ever
discovered
the
home
of
the
shamir
it
is
useless
to
seek
the
information
thou
desirest
by
consulting
the
sons
of
men
has
not
god
bestowed
upon
thee
knowledge
and
understanding
more
than
he
has
given
to
any
one
else
is
it
for
nought
that
thy
wisdom
exceeds
that
of
all
the
children
of
men
art
thou
not
ruler
of
all
the
spirits
and
demons
seek
their
aid
sire
and
thou
wilt
find
the
shamir
invoke
the
wisest
of
the
spirits
who
will
reveal
to
thee
even
the
secrets
of
the
heavens
above
of
the
earth
beneath
and
of
the
waters
under
the
earth
the
good
advice
of
the
counsellor
appealed
with
irresistible
conviction
to
solomons
heart
and
after
thanking
his
wise
minister
dismissed
his
council
in
order
to
carry
out
the
suggested
plan
he
looked
at
the
ring
on
his
right
hand
and
read
the
holy
name
of
god
engraved
thereon
no
sooner
had
he
pronounced
the
divine
name
than
a
demon
appeared
before
him
and
making
obeisance
cried
what
is
thy
wish
solomon
king
of
israel
i
command
thee
said
solomon
to
tell
me
where
is
the
worm
shamir
to
be
found
in
a
trembling
voice
the
demon
replied
mighty
king
of
man
and
spirits
i
am
thy
servant
i
will
always
obey
thee
if
i
have
the
power
so
to
do
be
not
angry
with
me
for
i
fear
i
cannot
help
thee
now
the
secret
thou
desirest
to
know
has
not
been
revealed
to
any
of
the
inferior
demons
it
is
only
ashmodai
our
king
who
is
in
possession
of
the
secret
tell
me
interrupted
king
solomon
where
does
ashmodai
the
king
of
the
demons
dwell
may
it
please
your
gracious
majesty
the
demon
responded
ashmodai
lives
far
far
away
from
the
haunts
of
men
his
palace
is
built
on
the
top
of
a
very
high
mountain
in
this
same
mountain
he
has
had
a
very
deep
well
dug
daily
he
fetches
his
drinking
water
from
this
well
when
he
has
obtained
sufficient
water
for
his
immediate
needs
he
closes
up
the
mouth
of
the
well
with
an
enormous
rock
which
he
seals
with
his
signetring
he
then
flies
up
to
heaven
to
receive
the
orders
of
those
who
are
his
superiors
his
tasks
take
him
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
even
beyond
the
great
sea
with
the
going
down
of
the
sun
in
the
west
he
returns
to
his
own
home
he
examines
very
carefully
the
seal
on
the
rock
at
the
mouth
of
the
well
in
order
to
find
out
if
it
has
been
tampered
with
in
his
absence
he
then
proceeds
to
uncover
the
well
and
he
partakes
of
the
water
having
quenched
his
thirst
he
covers
up
again
the
mouth
of
the
well
and
seals
it
afresh
king
solomon
sat
on
his
wonderful
throne
of
gold
whilst
the
demon
told
his
tale
not
a
word
escaped
the
memory
of
the
wise
king
he
then
dismissed
the
demon
who
disappeared
in
less
than
a
second
thereupon
solomon
summoned
to
his
presence
his
brave
captain
and
friend
benaiah
son
of
jehoiada
he
told
him
briefly
the
nature
of
the
task
he
was
chosen
to
undertake
saying
go
trusty
servant
benaiah
and
capture
ashmodai
the
king
of
the
demons
and
bring
him
before
my
presence
to
assist
thee
in
thy
arduous
and
perilous
undertaking
i
will
give
thee
this
golden
chain
on
the
links
of
which
the
letters
forming
the
divine
name
are
engraved
i
also
will
entrust
to
thy
care
my
signetring
which
is
also
engraved
with
the
holy
name
of
the
most
high
take
with
thee
also
this
large
bundle
of
white
wool
and
these
skins
full
of
strong
wine
after
giving
him
minute
instructions
about
the
journey
and
the
way
to
overcome
ashmodai
he
sent
benaiah
on
his
way
wishing
him
complete
success
in
all
his
undertaking
the
brave
warrior
confident
of
success
set
out
on
his
dangerous
expedition
after
many
days
of
hard
riding
across
the
great
desert
he
ultimately
reached
his
destination
never
had
he
seen
such
a
desolate
spot
in
front
of
him
stood
the
towering
mountain
without
sign
of
any
human
habitation
in
the
vicinity
the
mountain
seemed
to
be
the
abode
of
silence
and
death
undaunted
by
the
uncanny
scene
benaiah
began
the
ascent
of
the
rugged
mountain
with
a
stout
heart
he
feared
neither
man
nor
spirit
for
he
was
wearing
on
his
little
finger
king
solomons
signetring
when
halfway
up
the
mountain
he
bored
a
hole
in
order
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
ashmodais
well
great
was
his
delight
when
he
discovered
the
position
of
the
well
he
drew
off
the
water
and
stopped
up
the
hole
with
the
wool
which
he
had
brought
with
him
quite
near
to
this
hole
benaiah
pierced
an
aperture
which
ran
into
the
well
through
this
channel
he
poured
all
the
wine
in
the
skins
after
this
labour
was
completed
he
concealed
himself
behind
a
large
crag
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
arrival
of
the
king
of
the
demons
soon
after
sunset
ashmodai
drew
nigh
he
carefully
examined
the
seal
on
the
rock
over
the
mouth
of
the
well
and
found
it
intact
even
as
he
had
left
it
early
in
the
morning
after
he
had
rolled
away
the
rock
he
descended
into
the
well
to
quench
his
thirst
the
strange
odour
of
the
fragrant
wine
overpowered
him
so
that
he
quickly
returned
to
the
mouth
of
the
well
to
inhale
the
fresh
mountain
air
realizing
that
the
well
had
been
tampered
with
he
again
examined
the
seal
but
it
did
not
appear
to
have
been
touched
meanwhile
a
burning
thirst
in
his
throat
forced
him
to
descend
again
in
order
to
obtain
something
to
drink
no
sooner
had
he
tasted
the
wine
than
he
desired
to
drink
more
and
more
after
he
had
partaken
very
freely
of
the
strong
wine
he
felt
quite
drowsy
all
his
senses
were
overpowered
his
head
became
heavy
his
body
staggered
and
his
knees
gave
way
at
last
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
slept
soundly
benaiah
now
came
forth
from
his
hidingplace
and
crept
very
quietly
to
the
sleeping
demon
without
wasting
a
moment
the
good
captain
threw
the
golden
chain
around
ashmodais
neck
and
secured
it
and
sealed
it
with
the
golden
signetring
engraved
with
the
divine
name
benaiah
sat
on
the
ground
close
by
waiting
for
the
effects
of
the
strong
wine
to
wear
off
after
a
while
ashmodai
awoke
and
found
that
he
was
no
longer
free
for
he
saw
the
golden
chain
around
his
neck
and
he
beheld
the
holy
name
on
the
seal
he
uttered
such
a
terrible
groan
that
the
mountain
shook
in
vain
ashmodai
endeavoured
to
rise
up
in
his
anger
sparks
of
fire
flew
from
his
eyes
and
foam
covered
his
mouth
he
continued
to
wriggle
and
to
struggle
with
the
air
but
all
to
no
purpose
he
could
not
arise
he
looked
at
benaiah
and
cried
in
bitter
anger
is
it
thou
who
hast
bewitched
me
verily
replied
benaiah
behold
the
name
of
the
lord
of
lords
is
upon
thee
ashmodai
immediately
became
quiet
and
calm
he
knew
that
he
was
vanquished
and
realized
that
all
further
resistance
would
be
futile
he
told
benaiah
that
he
was
quite
ready
to
obey
his
orders
come
then
cried
benaiah
we
will
go
at
once
to
king
solomon
thy
master
arise
and
follow
me
ashmodai
arose
and
followed
benaiah
who
was
surprised
at
the
peculiar
behaviour
of
his
captive
on
their
way
to
the
holy
city
wherever
they
passed
ashmodai
left
behind
him
a
trace
of
his
might
or
intelligence
in
one
village
he
brushed
against
a
palm
tree
after
its
foliage
had
been
shaken
off
by
the
terrific
impact
he
uprooted
it
with
one
hand
in
another
place
he
knocked
his
shoulder
against
a
house
and
overturned
it
in
a
marketplace
in
a
large
town
they
met
a
happy
bridal
procession
when
the
bride
and
bridegroom
passed
ashmodai
began
to
weep
why
dost
thou
weep
benaiah
asked
in
surprise
alas
replied
ashmodai
within
three
days
the
bridegroom
will
be
a
corpse
do
i
not
do
well
to
weep
in
the
next
town
on
their
journey
they
overheard
a
farmer
asking
a
bootmaker
to
make
a
pair
of
shoes
which
were
to
last
him
for
seven
years
whereupon
ashmodai
burst
out
laughing
tell
me
ashmodai
cried
benaiah
why
dost
thou
laugh
because
the
poor
fellow
will
not
wear
his
shoes
for
even
seven
days
behold
within
a
week
he
will
dieyet
he
asks
for
shoes
to
last
him
seven
years
one
day
they
met
a
blind
man
going
astray
ashmodai
hastened
to
set
him
on
the
right
path
he
showed
a
similar
kindness
to
a
drunkard
whom
they
met
at
the
crossroads
on
another
occasion
they
saw
a
magician
who
was
exhibiting
his
skill
in
public
he
claimed
to
be
able
to
read
the
future
and
to
disclose
secrets
here
again
ashmodai
found
occasion
for
mirth
and
laughter
when
benaiah
asked
him
to
explain
his
strange
conduct
he
remarked
wouldst
thou
not
laugh
also
at
a
man
who
pretends
to
reveal
secrets
whilst
at
the
same
moment
he
is
unaware
of
the
fact
that
a
treasure
lies
buried
at
his
feet
we
demons
judge
persons
and
things
according
to
their
true
value
and
not
according
to
their
deceptive
appearance
in
the
eyes
of
man
after
many
strange
adventures
they
finally
came
to
the
holy
city
benaiah
conducted
his
captive
to
the
royal
presence
as
soon
as
ashmodai
beheld
king
solomon
fear
seized
him
and
he
began
to
tremble
violently
in
every
limb
he
held
a
long
staff
in
his
hand
on
which
he
supported
himself
after
his
attack
of
nervousness
had
subsided
ashmodai
threw
his
staff
before
the
king
what
art
thou
doing
asked
solomon
mighty
sovereign
gracious
master
replied
ashmodai
dost
thou
not
know
that
in
spite
of
all
thy
splendour
and
glory
thou
wilt
occupy
after
thy
death
no
more
space
in
the
earth
than
is
measured
by
yonder
staff
yet
thou
art
not
satisfied
with
ruling
the
children
of
men
but
thou
must
needs
hold
the
spirits
and
demons
in
subjection
be
not
vexed
solomon
said
in
a
gentle
tone
of
voice
thou
wilt
not
find
me
a
hard
master
i
merely
demand
one
little
service
at
thy
hands
know
then
that
i
wish
to
build
a
great
temple
to
the
glory
of
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
and
for
this
purpose
i
require
the
services
of
the
wonderful
worm
shamir
tell
me
now
where
can
i
find
this
tiny
creature
o
wisest
of
mortals
replied
ashmodai
dost
thou
not
really
know
that
the
shamir
has
not
been
placed
in
my
charge
why
then
hast
thou
brought
me
here
where
is
it
thundered
solomon
speak
slave
and
speak
truly
ashmodai
with
a
trembling
voice
replied
mighty
master
since
the
days
of
moses
who
employed
the
shamir
when
writing
on
the
tablets
of
stone
the
worm
has
been
entrusted
to
the
care
of
the
prince
of
the
sea
who
has
given
it
into
the
charge
of
the
woodcock
the
latter
has
sworn
to
the
prince
of
the
sea
to
carry
the
shamir
with
him
at
all
times
the
woodcock
lives
in
a
big
nest
built
on
the
top
of
a
very
lofty
pinnacle
in
a
mountain
range
he
has
employed
the
shamir
to
split
the
hard
rock
so
as
to
plant
seed
in
the
clefts
the
new
vegetation
which
grows
there
is
used
for
food
by
the
woodcock
whenever
he
goes
from
his
nest
he
takes
the
shamir
with
him
carrying
it
beneath
his
wing
mindful
of
his
oath
to
the
prince
of
the
sea
enough
cried
solomon
thou
shalt
abide
with
me
till
the
temple
is
built
once
again
king
solomon
summoned
his
trusty
captain
benaiah
telling
him
to
discover
the
nest
of
the
woodcock
and
to
obtain
the
shamir
and
to
bring
it
back
to
the
holy
city
take
with
thee
said
the
king
a
glass
cover
a
little
wool
and
a
small
leaden
box
may
thy
journey
be
as
successful
this
time
as
thy
former
one
benaiah
obeyed
with
a
glad
heart
all
the
instructions
which
king
solomon
had
given
he
set
out
on
his
journey
crossing
hill
and
dale
stream
and
desert
at
last
he
discovered
the
nest
of
the
bird
he
sought
the
woodcock
was
away
on
one
of
his
expeditions
in
the
nest
were
the
fledgelings
benaiah
now
covered
the
nest
with
the
glass
cover
which
he
had
brought
with
him
for
this
purpose
he
then
concealed
himself
and
awaited
events
when
the
woodcock
returned
he
attempted
to
enter
his
nest
but
found
himself
foiled
for
the
glass
was
very
hard
and
strong
he
saw
through
the
glass
his
helpless
young
and
flapping
his
wings
and
screeching
loudly
tried
to
break
the
glass
all
his
efforts
were
in
vain
the
young
birds
frightened
by
the
noise
also
began
to
screech
what
is
to
be
done
cried
the
woodcock
in
the
language
of
the
birds
again
and
again
he
tried
to
smash
the
glass
but
without
success
as
a
last
resource
he
determined
to
make
use
of
the
precious
treasure
entrusted
to
his
care
he
produced
the
shamir
from
beneath
his
wing
and
put
it
on
the
glass
which
split
into
pieces
as
soon
as
it
was
touched
by
the
wonderful
worm
at
that
instant
benaiah
raised
a
lusty
cry
and
frightened
the
woodcock
so
that
he
dropped
the
shamir
it
had
barely
fallen
upon
the
ground
when
it
was
seized
by
benaiah
who
carefully
placed
it
in
the
wool
and
secured
it
by
putting
it
in
the
small
leaden
box
which
he
had
brought
for
this
special
purpose
without
lingering
a
moment
benaiah
set
out
on
his
homeward
journey
rejoicing
greatly
at
his
complete
success
in
chagrin
the
woodcock
killed
himself
fearing
the
terrible
vengeance
which
the
prince
of
the
sea
would
execute
when
the
disappearance
of
the
shamir
became
known
benaiah
reached
the
holy
city
in
safety
and
delivered
to
king
solomon
the
wonderful
worm
with
its
marvellous
help
the
wise
king
built
the
temple
and
thereafter
the
shamir
has
disappeared
and
no
one
knows
where
it
is
to
be
found

falsehood
and

after
good
old
father
noah
had
completed
the
building
of
the
ark
the
animals
were
gathered
together
near
it
by
the
angels
appointed
over
them
they
came
in
pairs
and
noah
stood
at
the
door
of
the
ark
to
see
that
each
one
entered
with
its
mate
as
soon
as
the
waters
of
the
flood
rose
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
children
of

hid
themselves
in

homes

ceased
for
the
angel
of
death

abroad
this
state
of

caused
falsehood
to
realize
that
henceforth
there
was
no
chance
of
her
plying
her
trade
was
it
not
quite
evident
that
the
everincreasing
waters
of
the
flood
would
soon
sweep
away
the
wicked
folk
who
had
rebelled
against
their
heavenly
creator
where
should
falsehood
betake
herself
for
safety
forthwith
she
hastened
to
the
ark
but
its
door
was
shut
what
was
to
be
done
falsehood
knocked
at
the
door
with
trembling
hand
noah
opened
the
window
of
the
ark
and
put
out
his
head
to
see
who
was
knocking
it
was
a
strange
creature
before
his
door
noah
had
never
seen
her
before
because
he
was
a
righteous
man
who
never
told

what
dost
thou
want
he
cried
let

replied
gladly

thee
if
thy

and
disappointment
falsehood
went
away
she
had
not
gone
a
few
yards
before
she
met
her
old
friend
wickedness
who
was
now
out
of
employment
whence
cometh
thou
dear
friend
falsehood
asked
wickedness
i
come
said
falsehood
from
old
father
noah
just
listen
i
asked
him
to
let
me
come
into
the
ark
but
he
refused
unless
i
complied
with
his
rules
what
does
he
require
asked
wickedness
the
good
old
man
stipulated
that
i
must
have
a
mate
because
all
the
creatures
admitted
into
the
ark
are
in
pairs
falsehood
replied
now
dear
friend
is
this
the
truth
queried
wickedness
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
evil
eye
of
course
it
is
the
truth
on
my
word
of
honour
rejoined
falsehood
come
now
she
added
wilt
thou
be
my
mate
are
we
not
just
fit
to
be
joined
together
two
honest
and
poor
creatures
if
i
agree
said
wickedness
what
wilt
thou
give
me
in
return
falsehood
thought
awhile
and
with
a
cunning
look
at
her
friend
she
exclaimed
i
faithfully
promise
to
give
to
thee
all
that
i
earn
in
the
ark
have
no
fear
i
shall
do
excellent
business
even
there
because
i
feel
very
fit
and
energetic
wickedness
agreed
to
the
terms
immediately
and
there
and
then
a
proper
agreement
was
drawn
up
and
duly
signed
and
sealed
without
further
delay
they
both
hastened
to
noah
who
readily
admitted
the
happy
pair
falsehood
soon
began
to
be
very
busy
and
earned
good
money
she
often
thought
of
her
agreement
with
wickedness
with
regret
as
she
realized
that
she
alone
did
all
the
business
she
even
said
to
him
one
day
look
here
how
easily
can
i
carry
on
my
trade
singlehanded
he
merely
reminded
her
of
the
agreement
and
day
by
day
he
wrote
down
in
his
ledger
the
sum
total
of
the
days
takings
at
the
end
of
the
year
for
the
flood
lasted
twelve
months
they
came
out
of
the
ark
falsehood
brought
home
much
treasure
but
wickedness
came
with
her
and
claimed
the
whole
of
the
hardearned
fortune
thereupon
falsehood
said
to
herself
i
will
ask
my
mate
to
give
me
some
of
my
earnings
she
approached
wickedness
and
in
a
gentle
voice
said
dearest
friend
please
give
me
a
share
of
what
i
have
so
honestly
earned
for
i
alone
did
all
the
work
wickedness
looked
at
her
in
contempt
and
with
harsh
voice
cried
aloud
thy
share
is
nought
o
cheat
did
we
not
solemnly
agree
that
i
was
to
take
everything
which
thou
shouldst
earn
how
could
i
break
our
agreement
would
this
not
be
a
very
wicked
thing
to
do
now
would
it
not
falsehood
held
her
peace
and
went
away
well
knowing
that
she
had
been
foiled
in
her
attempt
to
cheat
her
friend

his
hands
came
to
him
and
said
will
you
buy
this
casket
what
is
the
price
asked
chaninah
i
will
take
eighty
pieces
of
silver
for
it
answered
the
merchant
and
he
added
i
will
not
accept
any
less
chaninah
agreed
and
there
and
then
paid
the
large
sum
of
money
demanded
thinking
all
the
while
of
his
dear
fathers
last
wish
the
money
which
he
had
spent
in
buying
the
casket
was
nearly
all
the
fortune
he
possessed
without
any
further
delay
he
returned
home
with
his
purchase
which
he
was
anxious
to
show
to
his
wife
look
here
he
cried
i
have
spent
nearly
all
our
money
in
buying
this
casket
even
as
dear
father
told
me
to
do
just
before
he
died
open
it
said
his
wife
there
is
sure
to
be
something
very
valuable
inside
it
he
lifted
the
lid
of
the
casket
and
was
astonished
to
find
that
it
contained
another
silver
box
he
took
this
out
and
opened
it
curious
to
learn
what
was
inside
to
their
great
surprise
a
little
green
frog
leapt
out
well
i
never
cried
chaninah
this
is
an
expensive
creature
do
not
forget
his
wife
said
your
fathers
command
to
be
kind
to
the
dumb
creatures
quite
right
says
her
husband
we
will
provide
for
the
frog
even
as
though
the
little
fellow
were
one
of
us
the
frog
grew
larger
and
larger
and
the
silver
box
was
no
longer
large
enough
for
its
quarters
chaninah
therefore
made
a
nice
roomy
cupboard
for
their
new
friends
abode
after
a
while
the
wife
told
her
husband
that
there
was
no
more
money
left
to
buy
food
with
a
very
sad
heart
the
good
man
called
the
frog
to
his
side
and
said
i
am
awfully
sorry
to
tell
you
dear
little
friend
that
we
cannot
feed
you
any
longer
because
we
have
no
food
left
even
for
ourselves
please
dont
worry
cried
the
frog
i
hope
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
indeed
more
than
grateful
to
you
both
for
all
your
kindness
and
hospitality
let
me
prove
my
gratitude
by
giving
you
this
piece
of
advice
in
the
box
where
you
found
me
you
will
see
a
strip
of
parchment
if
you
place
it
in
the
fold
of
your
turban
you
will
be
able
to
understand
not
only
the
different
languages
of
mankind
but
also
the
speech
of
birds
fish
and
beasts
chaninah
did
exactly
as
the
frog
told
him
and
calling
his
wife
told
her
that
they
would
accompany
the
frog
to
his
new
home
wherever
it
might
be
the
frog
said
this
should
be
in
a
pond
in
the
wood
near
by
they
all
went
to
the
wood
feeling
sad
that
poverty
was
forcing
them
to
part
company
as
soon
as
they
came
to
the
wood
the
frog
told
them
to
rest
themselves
then
at
the
bidding
of
the
frog
the
birds
and
beasts
in
the
wood
brought
to
chaninah
and
his
wife
an
immense
quantity
of
valuable
gems
and
an
assortment
of
roots
and
herbs
the
kindhearted
frog
gave
these
gifts
to
his
good
friends
explaining
how
the
herbs
and
roots
were
to
be
used
for
healing
purposes
then
at
last
the
frog
bids
his
friends
farewell
and
tells
them
that
he
was
really
a
son
of
adam
and
the
demon
lilith
and
that
he
had
the
power
of
changing
himself
into
any
shape
chaninah
and
his
wife
gathered
up
the
precious
gems
roots
and
herbs
and
returned
home
on
the
way
they
met
a
caravan
and
offered
some
of
the
gems
for
sale
a
good
bargain
was
struck
and
chaninah
and
his
wife
found
themselves
with
plenty
of
money
they
left
their
old
home
and
bought
a
nice
house
riches
did
not
spoil
them
for
their
hearts
were
kind
moreover
chaninah
kept
faithfully
the
charge
of
his
beloved
father
he
studied
the
holy
words
of
scripture
by
day
and
by
night
and
observed
the
divine
precepts
with
a
good
will
their
home
was
always
open
to
the
poor
the
good
fortune
of
chaninah
spread
far
and
wide
his
reputation
as
a
charitable
man
reached
the
ears
of
the
king
who
invited
him
to
visit
his
court
the
king
took
a
great
fancy
to
chaninah
and
persuaded
him
to
take
up
his
abode
in
the
palace
the
king
was
by
no
means
a
pious
man
in
fact
he
was
very
wicked
and
cruel
he
was
unmarried
and
this
fact
alone
displeased
his
subjects
his
counsellors
urged
him
to
find
a
good
wife
saying
to
him
let
us
o
king
remind
you
that
we
require
not
only
a
king
but
also
a
queen
and
little
princes
for
there
will
surely
come
a
time
when
a
new
king
will
have
to
be
foundbecause
kings
and
queens
are
mortals
and
they
cannot
live
for
ever
they
did
not
tell
the
king
what
their
real
motive
was
in
advising
him
to
marry
they
thought
that
if
the
king
were
to
find
a
true
and
good
wife
it
might
be
possible
for
her
to
use
her
influence
and
make
him
a
better
man
the
king
dismissed
his
counsellors
promising
to
see
them
again
in
a
weeks
time
when
he
would
tell
them
whether
he
would
marry
or
not
when
they
came
to
the
palace
at
the
appointed
time
the
kings
valet
met
them
and
told
them
that
his
majesty
would
receive
them
in
the
palace
garden
they
went
there
and
found
the
king
sitting
on
his
throne
as
they
approached
he
rose
up
and
bade
them
welcome
at
that
moment
a
beautiful
bird
flew
over
the
king
and
dropped
a
long
golden
hair
upon
his
shoulder
the
king
took
the
hair
in
his
hand
and
turning
to
his
counsellors
said
i
will
marry
only
the
maiden
to
whom
this
golden
hair
belongs
no
other
wife
shall
be
mine
you
wish
me
to
marrywell
and
goodso
be
it
i
now
command
you
to
discover
the
owner
of
this
golden
hair
and
mark
you
if
you
do
not
bring
her
to
me
within
a
year
from
today
i
will
have
you
and
all
your
families
put
to
death
the
counsellors
were
greatly
distressed
at
the
turn
of
events
they
feared
that
their
lives
would
be
forfeit
how
were
they
to
find
the
lady
whose
golden
hair
had
brought
misfortune
to
them
and
their
families
with
sad
hearts
they
left
the
royal
presence
and
when
they
were
outside
the
palace
they
asked
one
another
what
is
to
be
done
chaninah
who
was
now
one
of
the
kings
counsellors
offered
to
find
the
lady
destined
to
be
their
queen
he
hastened
home
to
bid
his
wife
farewell
and
to
prepare
for
his
journey
he
took
a
bag
into
which
he
put
six
loaves
a
small
assortment
of
his
precious
herbs
and
roots
and
twelve
silver
coins
having
blessed
his
wife
he
set
out
on
his
quest
he
walked
during
the
best
part
of
the
day
and
at
sunset
feeling
very
tired
he
sat
down
on
a
large
stone
beneath
a
tree
he
was
just
about
to
doze
off
when
he
was
suddenly
startled
by
hearing
a
ravens
croak
he
listened
and
understood
that
the
bird
had
not
found
any
food
for
three
days
he
at
once
opened
his
bag
and
gave
the
raven
a
large
piece
of
bread
on
the
morrow
chaninah
met
a
dog
howling
miserably
come
and
tell
me
he
said
to
the
dog
all
your
troubles
i
understand
the
speech
of
beasts
and
birds
the
dog
said
that
he
was
very
ill
and
hungry
for
it
was
just
a
week
since
he
had
eaten
any
food
chaninah
gave
him
one
of
the
healing
roots
and
a
loaf
of
bread
the
dog
devoured
the
bread
and
ate
the
root
and
thanked
his
good
friend
next
day
chaninah
came
to
a
river
and
found
some
fishermen
trying
in
vain
to
pull
in
their
net
which
contained
a
large
fish
the
fishermen
pulled
so
hard
that
they
feared
their
net
would
break
chaninah
lent
them
a
willing
hand
and
then
they
were
able
to
pull
in
the
net
the
fishermen
shouted
with
joy
we
have
enough
now
for
dinner
today
and
tomorrow
chaninah
asked
them
to
sell
the
fish
and
he
would
give
them
twelve
pieces
of
silver
as
its
price
they
agreed
and
gave
him
the
fish
as
soon
as
he
had
paid
them
they
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
when
they
saw
chaninah
throwing
the
fish
back
into
the
river
bidding
them
farewell
he
continued
his
journey
at
last
he
came
to
a
large
town
where
unknown
to
him
dwelt
the
maiden
whom
he
was
seeking
she
was
a
princess
the
only
daughter
of
the
king
of
that
country
chaninah
came
to
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
and
stood
still
awhile
gazing
around
the
princess
was
looking
out
of
the
window
of
her
room
and
saw
chaninah
whose
strange
attire
attracted
her
attention
she
sends
her
chamberlain
to
bring
him
to
her
presence
in
reply
to
her
inquiry
as
to
the
why
and
wherefore
of
his
visit
to
her
fathers
land
chaninah
tells
her
the
story
of
his
quest
looking
at
her
he
sees
that
she
is
the
very
lady
whom
he
has
to
find
to
be
the
wife
of
the
king
his
master
for
her
tresses
were
golden
even
like
the
hue
of
the
hair
which
the
king
found
upon
his
shoulder
come
good
lady
with
me
he
cries
and
save
my
people
the
wise
men
of
israel
and
their
families
who
are
in
mortal
danger
come
and
be
queen
in
our
land
and
save
the
soul
of
our
lord
the
king
the
princess
had
listened
very
attentively
to
all
the
strange
story
told
by
chaninah
and
in
reply
she
said
well
do
i
remember
drying
my
hair
one
day
last
month
in
the
garden
of
our
palace
and
whilst
doing
so
a
strange
bird
flew
over
my
head
three
times
and
then
plucked
out
one
of
my
hairs
he
flew
away
with
the
hair
and
i
can
now
believe
that
this
is
the
very
bird
which
brought
my
hair
to
the
king
of
your
land
i
will
accede
to
your
wish
and
consent
to
become
the
queen
of
your
land
if
you
fulfil
two
tasks
which
i
will
set
you
the
first
i
will
mention
at
once
here
i
have
two
empty
flasks
you
must
bring
them
back
to
me
full
of
water
i
do
not
mean
the
water
of
the
brook
or
well
but
the
one
flask
must
contain
water
from
paradise
and
the
other
must
be
filled
with
water
from
hell
when
you
have
done
this
task
i
will
tell
you
all
about
the
second
one
with
a
kind
word
of
farewell
the
princess
dismissed
chaninah
he
left
the
palace
with
a
sad
heart
and
prayed
to
god
to
help
him
in
his
difficulty
was
he
not
trying
to
save
the
lives
of
his
brethren
in
the
holy
land
after
a
little
while
he
hears
the
croak
of
a
raven
speaking
as
follows
dear
friend
do
you
no
longer
remember
me
did
you
not
give
me
bread
when
you
met
me
i
was
so
hungry
then
for
i
had
not
tasted
any
food
for
three
days
now
just
tell
me
how
can
i
be
of
service
i
will
gladly
do
my
best
to
please
you
chaninah
told
the
raven
all
about
the
task
which
the
princess
had
set
him
to
do
here
are
the
flasks
he
said
one
must
be
filled
with
water
from
paradise
and
the
other
must
be
filled
with
water
from
hell
the
raven
told
him
to
tie
a
flask
to
each
wing
and
at
sunset
to
be
at
the
spot
where
they
were
conversing
the
raven
flew
to
the
netherworld
and
singed
his
wings
in
passing
through
the
flames
of
hell
at
last
he
reached
the
black
boiling
waters
in
the
centre
of
hell
and
filled
one
flask
he
then
flew
to
the
gates
of
paradise
and
found
the
spring
which
flows
from
its
midst
and
bathed
in
its
cool
water
to
heal
his
wings
he
then
filled
the
other
flask
and
flew
to
the
spot
where
he
had
arranged
to
meet
his
friend
he
gave
the
flasks
filled
with
the
desired
water
to
chaninah
who
returned
to
the
palace
and
told
the
princess
that
the
task
was
done
the
princess
was
in
doubt
whether
the
water
of
each
flask
was
genuine
she
proposed
to
test
the
contents
there
and
then
opening
the
flask
containing
the
water
from
hell
she
poured
a
few
drops
upon
the
palm
of
her
hand
the
water
burnt
her
skin
and
she
quickly
put
some
of
the
water
of
the
other
flask
upon
the
burnt
spot
and
healed
it
at
once
she
told
chaninah
that
she
was
quite
satisfied
with
this
performance
but
now
she
said
you
have
to
perform
a
much
more
difficult
task
just
listen
some
years
ago
i
was
playing
with
my
ring
in
a
boat
and
by
accident
i
dropped
it
into
the
water
it
was
a
golden
ring
with
my
initials
engraved
on
the
gold
and
set
with
a
beautiful
pearl
restore
this
ring
and
when
i
have
it
again
i
will
comply
with
your
request
the
princess
thought
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
her
ring
and
that
she
would
not
be
bothered
to
accede
to
the
wish
of
chaninah
she
again
dismissed
him
with
a
few
kind
words
and
told
him
not
to
be
disappointed
if
he
failed
to
find
the
ring
chaninah
at
once
turned
his
thoughts
to
god
and
prayed
for
divine
help
he
then
went
to
the
nearest
river
hoping
that
his
good
fortune
would
not
forsake
him
as
soon
as
he
came
to
the
water
he
beheld
the
large
fish
which
he
had
purchased
and
thrown
back
into
the
river
tell
me
said
the
fish
what
you
desire
and
i
will
try
to
help
you
chaninah
told
the
fish
the
story
of
the
ring
of
the
princess
and
said
that
he
must
have
this
ring
as
soon
as
possible
meet
me
at
yonder
bridge
said
the
fish
tomorrow
morning
at
daybreak
and
i
will
bring
you
news
concerning
the
ring
the
fish
then
swam
away
and
made
for
the
bottom
of
the
great
sea
in
order
to
seek
the
help
of
leviathan
the
monster
king
of
the
deep
leviathan
welcomed
the
fish
and
having
heard
his
story
promised
to
help
him
he
issued
an
order
throughout
his
vast
kingdom
compelling
every
fish
to
report
to
him
if
any
such
ring
had
been
heard
of
or
discovered
if
he
should
discover
that
a
fish
had
the
ring
and
failed
to
produce
it
very
severe
penalties
were
sure
to
follow
within
an
hour
the
ring
was
brought
to
the
palace
of
leviathan
and
placed
before
his
throne
leviathan
then
gave
it
to
the
fish
which
had
promised
to
help
chaninah
next
morning
at
daybreak
the
fish
delivered
the
ring
to
chaninah
who
rejoiced
greatly
at
the
cleverness
of
the
fish
how
glad
he
was
that
he
had
fulfilled
his
dear
fathers
wishes
in
being
kind
to
birds
beasts
and
fish
at
noon
chaninah
entered
the
palace
and
was
brought
at
once
to
the
princess
behold
he
cried
in
a
joyful
voice
your
royal
highness
is
this
not
your
ring
your
initials
are
engraved
on
the
gold
the
princess
admitted
that
this
was
her
ring
and
as
the
two
tasks
which
she
had
imposed
had
been
satisfactorily
accomplished
she
now
consented
to
accompany
chaninah
to
the
holy
land
on
the
way
they
were
attacked
by
robbers
chaninah
fearing
that
he
would
be
overpowered
called
for
help
at
that
moment
a
dog
ran
up
to
his
side
and
barked
so
furiously
that
the
robbers
made
off
the
dog
was
glad
to
repay
chaninah
for
having
fed
him
and
healed
him
in
days
gone
by
at
last
they
came
to
the
holy
land
and
when
the
king
saw
the
beautiful
princess
with
the
golden
hair
he
was
very
happy
amidst
general
rejoicing
the
royal
wedding
took
place
the
king
rewarded
chaninah
by
making
him
his
chief
counsellor
of
state
the
good
mans
success
however
was
marred
by
a
great
misfortune
which
had
befallen
him
during
his
absence
his
good
wife
had
died
moreover
some
of
the
royal
servants
were
envious
of
his
advancement
in
the
kings
favour
they
resolved
to
hire
some
ruffians
who
were
to
waylay
him
one
day
as
he
was
leaving
the
palace
the
ruffians
attacked
him
and
killed
him
in
the
courtyard
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
sad
event
was
told
to
the
queen
she
cried
never
mind
let
me
see
what
can
be
done
she
went
to
her
cabinet
and
took
out
the
flask
containing
the
water
from
paradise
she
then
went
to
the
courtyard
where
the
king
and
nobles
were
gathered
around
the
corpse
make
way
for
her
majesty
the
queen
the
people
cried
when
the
queen
saw
the
dead
body
of
her
friend
she
smiled
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
she
sprinkled
some
of
the
precious
water
upon
the
corpse
and
immediately
chaninah
opened
his
eyes
and
arose
now
the
people
understood
why
the
queen
had
smiled
come
now
said
the
king
to
his
wife
kill
me
and
restore
me
to
life
again
i
should
just
like
to
know
how
it
feels
to
be
dead
the
queen
declined
to
murder
her
husband
and
turning
to
him
she
cried
do
not
be
so
wicked
life
is
sacred
moreover
the
wonderful
water
will
only
bring
a
person
back
to
life
provided
his
life
had
been
good
your
majesty
she
added
must
repent
and
mend
your
ways
otherwise
you
will
not
be
restored
to
life
in
the
hereafter
the
king
went
away
in
anger
and
returned
to
his
royal
apartments
here
he
ordered
one
of
his
servants
to
kill
him
if
you
refuse
cried
the
wicked
king
i
will
instantly
kill
you
whereupon
the
servant
obeyed
the
king
and
slew
him
the
queen
was
at
once
informed
of
the
wicked
death
of
the
king
she
was
truly
sorry
to
find
that
he
had
not
allowed
himself
to
be
influenced
by
her
advice
but
that
he
had
trifled
with
his
life
she
therefore
fetched
the
flask
containing
water
from
hell
then
she
sprinkled
its
contents
upon
the
body
of
the
wicked
king
his
body
immediately
was
burnt
to
ashes
she
thereupon
turned
to
the
astonished
members
of
the
court
who
were
looking
on
and
in
a
gentle
voice
she
said
do
you
not
see
good
friends
that
if
my
husband
had
been
a
good
and
holy
man
he
would
have
been
restored
to
life
just
like
chaninah
but
the
fact
is
that
he
was
a
cruel
and
bad
man
you
all
knew
this
even
before
i
came
here
from
my
fathers
land
after
the
burial
of
the
king
the
counsellors
came
to
the
queen
and
urged
her
to
marry
chaninah
who
had
proved
such
a
trusty
friend
the
suggestion
pleased
the
queen
who
gladly
gave
her
heart
and
hand
to
the
good
man
they
ruled
the
people
in
justice
and
kindness
and
as
long
as
they
reigned
there
was
peace
in
the
land
from
the
jewish
chap
book
maaseh
book
the
two
jewels
in
the
early
period
of
the
middle
ages
there
was
a
king
of
spain
pedro
by
name
he
was
a
wise
and
tolerant
ruler
in
his
kingdom
christians
jews
and
mohammedans
were
to
be
found
it
was
a
time
when
brotherly
love
was
to
be
discovered
in
the
holy
scriptures
only
king
pedro
was
one
day
about
to
set
out
at
the
head
of
his
army
to
attack
his
enemies
in
a
neighbouring
land
nicholas
of
valencia
one
of
the
royal
counsellors
came
to
pedro
and
exclaimed
o
most
gracious
sire
may
i
ask
your
majesty
a
question
ask
good
friend
nicholas
said
the
king
what
need
is
there
for
your
majesty
to
leave
your
kingdom
to
fight
your
enemies
beyond
the
border
when
you
have
so
many
dangerous
enemies
within
your
kingdom
to
whom
do
you
refer
cried
the
king
i
refer
to
all
disbelievers
in
spain
the
heretics
the
jews
and
the
followers
of
mahommetpeople
who
deny
the
divinity
of
our
lord
our
saviour
and
his
holy
mother
do
we
not
as
good
christians
hate
the
jews
and
moslems
and
do
they
not
hate
us
does
not
your
majesty
know
that
the
jews
are
commanded
in
their
holy
bible
to
abstain
from
greeting
the
christians
how
can
that
be
true
said
the
wise
king
since
the
hebrew
bible
was
written
at
a
time
when
there
were
no
christians
nevertheless
continued
nicholas
i
have
heard
it
said
that
even
though
a
jew
would
greet
a
christian
saying
to
him
peace
be
unto
you
he
immediately
adds
under
his
breath
but
may
the
devil
take
you
how
do
you
know
this
exclaimed
the
king
in
astonishment
i
was
told
this
replied
nicholas
by
a
most
saintly
man
one
geronimo
a
converted
jew
no
no
interrupted
pedro
i
would
not
believe
such
a
man
any
one
who
changes
his
religion
will
not
scruple
to
change
his
word
twisting
the
truth
into
falsehood
do
you
not
also
realize
that
the
testimony
of
such
a
convert
is
probably
unreliable
because
he
is
now
anxious
to
show
how
intensely
he
loves
his
new
faith
and
this
he
does
best
by
hating
the
religion
which
he
has
abandoned
your
majesty
may
be
right
said
nicholas
but
he
added
there
is
nothing
which
vexes
my
soul
so
much
as
the
unbounded
impudence
of
the
jews
who
would
not
hesitate
to
tell
your
majesty
that
their
religion
is
better
than
our
holy
faith
do
not
let
this
vex
you
good
nicholas
said
pedro
prove
your
statement
by
bringing
a
jew
before
me
and
let
me
hear
from
his
own
lips
this
glorification
of
his
religion
and
then
i
will
tell
you
whether
i
feel
vexed
or
not
nicholas
left
the
king
in
order
to
fetch
a
jew
as
commanded
by
his
royal
master
after
a
few
minutes
had
elapsed
he
returned
bringing
with
him
a
venerable
man
with
a
long
beard
white
as
the
driven
snow
welcome
exclaimed
king
pedro
be
seated
noble
jew
and
answer
me
without
fear
or
favour
any
questions
i
may
put
to
you
may
it
please
your
majesty
said
the
jew
who
had
risen
from
his
seat
when
about
to
speak
life
is
dear
to
me
and
mine
but
truth
and
honour
are
dearer
still
for
nearly
ninety
years
have
i
remained
steadfast
to
the
faith
of
my
fathers
i
most
humbly
beg
your
majesty
to
suffer
me
and
my
people
to
continue
to
be
loyal
not
only
to
god
our
heavenly
king
but
also
to
your
majesty
have
no
fear
good
jew
but
now
tell
me
your
name
says
king
pedro
i
am
called
he
replies
ephraim
the
son
of
sancho
now
will
you
tell
me
asks
the
king
which
religion
judaism
or
christianity
is
more
true
and
real
after
a
moments
thought
ephraim
replies
my
religion
is
the
only
good
one
for
me
in
view
of
my
circumstances
your
majesty
knows
that
my
ancestors
the
children
of
israel
were
once
slaves
in
the
land
of
egypt
god
in
his
great
mercy
redeemed
my
people
from
that
land
of
bondage
with
signs
and
wonders
my
religion
is
bound
up
with
this
wonderful
love
of
god
who
not
only
redeemed
us
but
he
also
gave
us
our
laws
and
commandments
in
keeping
these
laws
and
commandments
we
serve
god
and
this
is
our
religion
and
it
is
the
most
natural
for
the
people
of
israel
for
your
majesty
however
who
is
born
to
rule
nations
and
creeds
your
religion
is
the
most
suitable
because
christianity
is
the
predominant
faith
which
has
cramped
my
religion
in
ghettos
and
darkness
christianity
has
even
resolved
in
this
land
to
drive
out
the
mohammedans
so
that
a
believer
in
the
koran
shall
not
be
found
in
catholic
spain
you
have
spoken
wisely
and
daringly
says
the
king
but
i
did
not
ask
you
to
discuss
the
various
religions
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
individual
believer
but
i
wished
to
know
which
religion
in
your
opinion
is
the
best
you
can
limit

discussing
whether
judaism
is
better
than
christianity
or
as
we

ephraim
replied
in
three
days
time
if
it
please
your
majesty
i
will
return
and
give
you
my
humble
opinion

cannot
promise
to
satisfy
your
majesty
but
i
will
do
my
best
to
justify
my
conscience
the
king
consented
to
this
proposal
and
dismissed
the
jew
with
a
friendly
farewell
three
days
later
the
king
and
nicholas
were
anxiously
awaiting
the
promised
reply
at
the
hour
appointed
ephraim
appeared
he
was
very
much
agitated
and
gasped
for
breath
most
heartily
welcome

friendly
voice

and

answer
to
my
question
ephraim
sat
in
silence
and
failed
to
control
his
agitation
what
is
the
matter
good
ephraim
asked
the
king
who
was
now
beginning
to
feel
concerned
at
the
jews
prolonged
silence
and
unusual
excitement
at
last
by
a
great
effort
ephraim
exclaimed
i
grieve
to
tell
your
majesty
that
i
am
ill
i
have
this
day
been
most
grossly
insulted
and
abused
i
am
perfectly
innocent
of
having
done
any
wrong
to
the
men
who
have
been
so
cruel
and
unjust
to
me
gracious
king
i
appeal
to
you
to
hear
my
complaint
and
to
see
that
justice
is
done

no
fear
cried
the
king
i
am
the
fountain
of
justice
and
every
one
in
my
realm
may
look
to
me
for
impartial
judgment
what
is
your
complaint
the
king
and
nicholas
turned
to
ephraim
and
anxiously
awaited
his
reply
my
story
is
as
follows
says
the
jew
a
month
ago
my
neighbour
went
away
from
home
on
a
very
long
journey
in
order
to
give
some
comfort
and
consolation
to
his
two
sons
during
his
absence
he
gave
a
precious
jewel
to
each
of
them
early
this
day
the
two
sons
of
my
good
neighbour
came
to
my
house
and
asked
to
see
me
i
received
them
very
politely
in
my
humble
apartment
and
asked
them
how
i
could
be
of
service
they
showed
me
their
jewels
and
demanded
that
i
should
there
and
then
explain
to
them
both
the
various
characteristics
of
the
gems
i
was
also
to
point
out
the
beauties
and
flawsif
anyin
the
precious
stones
they
asked
me
to
appraise
their
value
and
to
decide
which
of
the
two
was
the
better
and
the
more
valuable
i
told
them
that
there
was
no
one
so
well
qualified
to
answer
all
their
questions
as
their
dear
father
who
happens
to
be
an
eminent
authority
on
gems
for
he
is
a
jeweller
go
i
said
to
your
beloved
father
and
let
him
decide
for
he
will
tell
you
all
you
desire
to
know
about
the
jewels
and
whatever
he
tells
you
will
be
right
and
true
no
sooner
had
i
said
this
when
the
two
sons
attacked
me
striking
me
upon
my
head
they
abused
me
calling
me
heretic
and
jew
just
because
i
tried
to
answer
their
question
to
the
best
of
my
ability
truly
cried
the
king
in
a
passion
they
have
acted
most
shamefully
they
deserve
to
be
most
severely
punished
listen
o
sire
to
the
words
of
your
mouth
rejoined
ephraim
two
brothers
were
esau
and
jacob
and
to
each
one
did
their
father
give
a
precious
jewel
now
your
majesty
likewise
asks
me
to
decide
which
is
the
better
let
your
majesty
send
a
messenger
to
our
father
in
heaven
for
he
is
the
greatest
owner
of
jewels
and
he
will
be
able
to
explain
exactly
how
the
two
jewels
differ
and
he
will
also
tell
your
majesty
which
of
the
two
is
the
more
precious

him
do
you
not
see
how
wisely
this
learned
jew
has
answered
my
question
he
deserves
to
be
rewarded
not
only
for
his
wisdom
but
also
for
his
toleration
for
he
implies
that
our
religion
and
his
own
have
both
been
given
to
humanity
by
our
heavenly
father
who
in
his
own
good
time
will
decide
which
is
the

at
the
wedding
once
upon
a
time
long
ago
there
was
a
man
whose
fame
had
spread
far
and
wide
in
the
land
where
he
lived
he
was
exceedingly
goodhearted
and
as
he
had
plenty
of
money
he
was

a
gentle
and
good
wife
they
had
an
only
girl
named
hannah
in
time
hannah
grew
up
into
a
most
lovely
woman
whose
hand
and
fortune
were
sought
after
by
many
suitors
one
lover
in
particular
had
succeeded
in
gaining
her
favour
by
giving
a
few
pence
to
a
poor
man
whenever
hannah
drew
his
attention
to
the
one
in
distress
this
charity
however
was
not
genuine
for
if
alone
the
lover
would
refuse
to
listen
to
the
poor
hannah
consented
to
accept
this
suitor
as
her
husband
and
at

the
wedding

was
fixed
when

adornment
and
had
put
on
the
black
dress
of
a
mourner
all
that
had
happened
seemed
as
though
it
were
a
dream
to
the
poor
girl
even
her
parents
could
hardly
realize
the
terrible
misfortune
which
had
so
suddenly
befallen
them

the
wedding
and
today
was
to

the
funeral
of
the
luckless
husband

a

was

joy

of

cruel
fate
overtook
the

to

david
had
a
brother
named
samuel
who
lived
in
a
faroff
country
for
very
many
years
they
had
not
heard
from
one
another
in
their
youth
they
had
parted
each
bent
on
seeking
his
fortune
as
we
have
seen
david
had
become
very
wealthy
samuel
however
although
blessed
with
a
worthy
wife
and
ten
children
had
remained
a
poor
man
he
and
his
eldest
son
collected
wood
in
the
forest
near
their
hut
sometimes
they
were
lucky
and
sold
all
the
wood
which
they
had
gathered
one
day
they
failed
to
find
any
customers
and
when
they
returned
home
at
night
they
were
penniless
the
result
was
that
next
day
the
entire
family
were
without
food
again
that
day
samuel
and
his
eldest
son
whose
name
was
joseph
went
to
the
marketplace
to
sell
the
wood
but
without
any
success
they
resolved
to
spend
the
night
in
the
forest
rather
than
see
the
misery
of
the
starving
children
in
their
unhappy
home
samuel
and
joseph
prayed
to
god
for
help
after
a
while
joseph
turned
to
his
father
and
suggested
that
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
go
to
his
rich
uncle
david
and
to
ask
his
assistance
samuel
gladly
consented
to
this
proposal
early
next
morning
they
returned
home
and
told
their
dear
ones
about
the
plan
which
they
had
adopted
joseph
took
leave
of
his
beloved
parents
sisters
and
brothers
and
set
out
on
his
journey
fortified
by
the
prayers
and
blessings
of
all
the
family
when
he
came
to
his
uncles
house
he
was
received
with
a
hearty
welcome
his
aunt
and
uncle
inquired
after
the
welfare
of
josephs
parents
and
when
they
heard
of
the
terrible
poverty
in
josephs
home
they
immediately
sent
their
trusty
steward
to
help
the
family
with
food
money
and
clothing
joseph
wished
to
return
home
in
company
with
the
steward
but
he
was
persuaded
by
his
aunt
to
stay
with
his
uncle
for
a
short
visit
his
genial
presence
soon
brought
comfort
and
happiness
to
his
sad
cousin
hannah
often
did
they
sit
together
in
the
beautiful
garden
attached
to
davids
house
and
read
the
stirring
stories
of
the
bible
a
few
weeks
of
unclouded
happiness
soon
passed
by
and
joseph
thought
that
the
time
had
come
when
he
ought
to
return
home
he
went
to
his
uncle
one
morning
and
said
to
him
let
me
ask
you
dear
uncle
to
do
me
a
favour
which
you
can
readily
promise
to
do
you
have
given
me
so
much
already
i
shall
never
forget
all
your
love
and
kindness
one
thing
only
is
still
wanting
to
complete
my
hearts
desire
well
do
i
know
how
generously
you
have
assisted
my
beloved
father
and
mother

have
fed
and
clothed
my
poor
sisters
and
brothers
you
have
kept
me
here
for
many
a
happy
day
as
your
guest
if
you
do
not
promise
to
do
this
one
favour
which
i
am
about
to
ask
i
must
at
once
leave
you
and
return
to
my
own
home
for
i
fear
i
have
already
stayed
here
too
long
how
can
i
refuse
you
your
request
dear
joseph
cried
david
i
faithfully
promise
on
my
word
of
honour
to
do
what
you
ask
for
i
know
that
you
are
a
good
and
noble
lad
with
an
honest
and
kind
heart
i
am
sure
you
would
never
ask
for
aught
which
is
neither
right
nor
just
that
is
so
said
joseph
now
dear
uncle
since
you
have
given
me
your
promise
listen
to
my
request
i
know
you
do
not
really
wish
me
to
return
home
i
will
agree
to
stay
with
you
on
one
condition
and
make
your
home
mine
also
what
is
the
condition
cried
david
impatiently
the
condition
continued
joseph
is
that
you
give
me
your
consent
to
marry
my
dear
cousin
hannah
when
we
are
married
we
will
live
with
you
and
comfort
you
and
dear
aunt
for
the
rest
of
your
lives
davids
face
became
white
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
shook
his
head
what
you
are
asking
he
cried
is
impossible
do
you
not
know
dear
joseph
that
hannah
has
already
been
married
three
times
and
each
time
her
husband
died
in
the
night
following
the
wedding
you
are
really
asking
me
for
leave
to
die
and
i
dare
not
consent
please
do
not
try
to
persuade
me
to
agree
to
your
proposal
if
you
do
it
will
be
to
your
own
hurt
but
you
have
given
me
your
word
of
honour
to
grant
my
request
said
joseph
and
your
word
is
your
bond

the
sad
story
of
dear
hannahs
weddings

am
fully
aware
that
the
three
husbands
who
in
turn
married
my
dear
cousin

in
the
first
night
of
their
marriage
the
fault

david
with
tremulous
voice
addressed
his
nephew
saying
joseph
i
love
you
as
though
you
were
my
son
listen
well
to
what
i
am
about
to
say
if
by
marrying
my
daughter
you
think
you
will
obtain
her
fortune
tell
me
if
this
be
the
case
be
candid
and
i
will
satisfy
you
and
redeem
my
pledge
by
giving
you
her
dowry
nay
i
will
double
the
amount
if
you
agree
not
to
wed
my
child
if
this
should
not
satisfy
you

the
sum
of
money
you
desire
and
if
i
possess
it
it
shall
be
yours
i
will
gladly
give
it
with
a
good
will
only
do
not
risk
your
precious
life
by
running
into
danger
you
have
been
a
source
of
real
comfort
and
happiness
to
us
all
ever
since
you
set
foot
in
our
house
do
not
i
beseech
you
plunge
us
all
into
unutterable
misery
by
risking
your
life
to
marry
hannah
is
to
die
dear
uncle
joseph
cried
do
you
really
think
for
one
moment
that
i
wish
to
marry
hannah
for
the
sake
of
money
do
not
even
think
that
i
would
take
a
penny
piece
if
i
am
not
allowed
to
marry
her
i
do
not
think
of
money
or
worldly
things
now
for
i
know
that
love
is
the
best
of
all
treasures
in
hannah
have
i
found
my
ideal
she
alone
of
all
women
on
earth
will
be
mine
even
as
i
alone
of
all
men
will
be
hers
now
and
always
providence
is
not
against
us
for
i
feel
that
we
are
destined
to
make
one
another
happy
moreover
in
our
happiness
you
and
dear
aunt
will
find
your
true
peace
and
joy
seeing
the
folly
of
prolonging
the
discussion
david
consented
to
carry
out
his
promise
and
said
that
he
would
at
once
tell
the
news
to
hannah
and
her
mother
no
sooner
had
he
disclosed
the
proposal
to
his
daughter
than
she
began
to
weep
and
to
pray
to
god
for
his
support
and
counsel
joyfully
would
she
have
suffered
death
sooner
than
see
any
harm
befall
joseph
whom
she
loved
with
all
her
heart
she
knew
how
noble
was
his
character
and
she
realized
that
nothing
would
induce
him
to
change
his
mind
she
felt
that
she
was
helpless
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
except
to
put
her
life
and
that
of
her
beloved
joseph
in
the
hands
of
god
later
in
the
day
joseph
came
to
her
and
placed
the
engagement
ring
on
her
finger
meanwhile
saying
with
this
ring
art
thou
betrothed
unto
me
according
to
the
law
of
moses
and
of
israel
they
sealed
their
engagement
by
a
sweet
kiss
exchanging
promises
of
love
and
constancy
in
spite
of
her
happiness
tears
welled
up
in
her
eyes
for
she
knew
that
their
great
joy
and
love
were
in
the
balance
joseph
tried
to
console
her
by
telling
her
that
all
would
be
well
the
news
of
their
engagement
soon
spread
in
the
town
where
they
lived
and
the
friends
of
hannahs
parents
came
to
wish
the
couple
joy
and
good
luck
thinking
that
their
congratulations
would
gladden
the
hearts
of
hannah
and
of
her
parents
josephs
usual
good
humour
was
intensified
by
the
happy
event
he
sought
out
the
poor
to
whom
he
gave
gifts
of
money
well
remembering
the
poverty
in
which
he
had
lived
till
he
came
to
his
uncle
a
few
weeks
later
the
ceremony
of
marriage
was
fixed
to
be
celebrated
once
again
hannah
put
on
her
bridal
attire
thinking
the
while
of
the
terrible
misfortunes
she
had
experienced
at
last
the
hour
came
when
she
stood
with
joseph
at
her
side
beneath
the
wedding
canopy
just
as
the
marriage
service
was
about
to
begin
an
old
man
unknown
to
all
the
assembled
guests
approached
joseph
and
asked
him
to
give
him
a
moments
attention
because
he
had
to
tell
him
something
of
vital
importance
joseph
immediately
turned
aside
with
the
stranger
and
asked
him
if
he
required
any
help
the
stranger
replied
i
come
to
help
you
for
i
know
that
you
have
a
good
and
kind
heart
i
ask
you
to
remember
that
wealth
will
not
avail
in
the
hour
of
your
need
charity
alone
will
save
you
and
deliver
you
from
death
be
hospitable
this
day
and
invite
to
your
wedding
feast
the
poor
who
will
bless
you
for
your
kindness
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
and
now
let
me
go
for
i
wish
you
well

and
distress
the
marriage
service
began
and
at
its
conclusion
the
guests
took
their
places
at
the
banquet
at
the
head
of
the
table
sat
the
bridegroom
and
at
his
side
was
his
beautiful
bride
the
guests
began
to
eat
and
to
drink
when
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
seen
at
the
door
of
the
room
a
beggar
in
rags
and
tatters
his
skin
yellow
and
unwashed
his
hair
unkempt
and
his
stature
bent
his
eyes
were
flaming
like
fire
and
at
his
presence
profound
silence
obtained
not
a
sound
was
heard
within
the
room
all
was
hushed
in
strange
suspense
till
joseph
in
a
loud
and
fearless
voice
cried
come
hither
good
friend
you
are
most
welcome
at
this
my
marriage
feast
at
my
side
shall
you
sit
for
here
all
are
most
heartily
welcome
rich
and
poor
alike
joseph
told
the
servants
to
go
to
the
door
of
the
house
and
to
invite
all
the
poor
who
passed
by
to
join
his
guests
the
beggar
went
to
the
seat
next
to
josephs
and
sat
down
joseph
waited
on
his
unknown
guest
and
gave
him
of
the
best
when
the
banquet
was
over
the
bride
arose
and
retired
to
her
apartment
joseph
arose
likewise
and
was
about
to
follow
her
when
the
beggar
placed
his
hand
on
josephs
shoulder
and
said
in
a
whisper
i
must
have
just
one
word
with
you
in
private
please
i
cannot
stay
here
much
longer
but
i
have
to
tell
you
why
i
am
with
you
today
joseph
led
him
to
an
empty
room
and
requested
him
to
be
seated
after
a
moment
or
two
had
elapsed
the
stranger
began
to
speak
as
follows
my
friend
i
am
truly
sorry
for
your
own
and
also
for
your
dear
wifes
sake
but
i
have
come
here
on
a
very
sad
errand
i
am
sent
to
you
against
my
will
it
is
god
who
has
sent
me
here
to
take
you
to
him
prepare
now
to
leave
the
world
and
all
its
joys
joseph
looked
at
his
guest
without
fear
and
in
a
very
calm
voice
he
said
if
this
be
gods
will
so
be
it
done
in
love
and
obedience
nevertheless
i
do
beseech
you
grant
me
a
respitejust
one
year
in
happiness
with
my
wife
and
then
i
promise
to
go
with
you
no
my
good
friend
it
cannot
be
cried
the
angel
of
death
who
was
in
the
beggars
guise
not
even
a
month
said
the
angel
not
even
the
seven
days
of
rejoicing
appointed
to
be
kept
by
bride
and
bridegroom
not
even
one
days
delay
but
this
very
day
must
you
die
even
as
the
former
three
husbands
of
your
beloved
wife
joseph
made
haste
to
reply
gods
word
is
true
and
he
is
true
if
you
cannot
accede
to
my
petition
to
grant
me
a
respite
give
me
leave
to
go
to
my
wife
and
to
bid
her
farewell
this
will
i
gladly
allow
exclaimed
the
angel
in
return
for
your
kindness
to
me
this
day
you
knew
me
notyet
have
you
treated
me
as
a
friend
the
angel
spoke
so
gently
because
his
heart
was
full
of
sorrow
he
knew
that
joseph
was
a
good
and
true
man
and
it
grieved
him
to
lead
him
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
joseph
hastened
to
his
wifes
apartment
and
entered
he
found
her
rapt
in
prayer
with
tears
in
her
eyes
quick
my
beloved
he
whispered
my
time
is
very
short
i
cannot
stay
here
i
must
hasten
far
away
with
the
strange
beggar
he
has
come
to
fetch
me
let
me
bless
you
for
your
unfailing
sweetness
and
love
come
let
me
kiss
you
for
the
last
time
if
she
cried
you
hasten
away
i
will
go
with
you
for
now
we
are
one
and
nothing
shall
ever
part
us
not
even
cruel
death
itself
with
a
passionate
grip
she
took
his
hand
and
told
him
to
lead
her
to
the
beggar
when
she
saw
him
she
said
stranger
you
are
still
our
guest
beneath
our
roof
if
you
would
repay
our
hospitality
this
day
just
grant
me
one
little
favour
take
me
with
my
husband
to
the
eternal
judge
and
i
will
ask
him
whether
his
holy
word
in
the
law
is
true
is
it
not
written
therein
and
what
man
is
there
that
hath
betrothed
a
wife
and
hath
not
taken
her
let
him
go
and
return
to
his
house
lest
he
die
in
the
battle
and
another
man
take
her
deut
xx
nay
cried
the
angel
i
will
go
for
you
and
i
will
bring
you
answer
again
his
sorrow
for
the
unfortunate
bride
and
bridegroom
prompted
him
to
do
this
service
of
love
the
angel
added
i
will
join
in
the
choir
of
angels
who
praise
god
morning
and
evening
and
i
will
put
your
question
before
the
father
of
mercy
who
dwells
with
the
meek
and
the
brokenhearted
i
hope
for
the
sake
of
both
of
you
that
josephs
life
will
be
spared
in
a
moment
the
angel
was
gone
and
in
another
moment
he
returned
his
face
was
shining
with
heavenly
light
and
his
voice
was
sweet
and
soft
listen
he
said
good
friends
i
rejoice
to
tell
you
that
your
prayers
have
been
heard
live
well
and
long
together
enjoy
your
life
the
other
husbands
died
because
they
married
not
for
love
but
for
greed
of
gold
they
were
hardhearted
scorning
the
poor
and
the
weak
you
shall
live
to
help
others
to
live
and
to
prosper
farewell
and
in
a
second
the
angel
was
seen
no
more
the
bride
and
bridegroom
spent
that
night
in
giving
praise
to
god
for
his
love
and
mercy
the
parents
however
were
weeping
throughout
the
long
night
whilst
their
friends
had
prepared
the
grave
for
josephs
body
at
dawn
joseph
went
to
his
uncle
and
aunt
to
greet
them
they
were
greatly
overcome
with
joy
and
comforted
one
another
by
praying
together
to
the
almighty
all
then
hastened
to
fill
in
the
unused
grave
in
this
plot
they
planted
seeds
of
daffodils
so
that
in
time
to
come
they
might
look
upon
the
beautiful
flowers
as
an
emblem
of
the
divine
mercy
joseph
continued
to
be
charitable
and
kind
to
all
who
needed
his
help
whenever
the
people
saw
him
they
were
wont
to
exclaim

the
clever
wife
long
long
ago
there
lived
in
the
old
town
of
sidon
a
happy
couple
named
abraham
and
ada
although
they
loved
one
another
very
much
still
there
was
something
wanting
to
complete
their
happiness
they
had
been
married
for
nearly
ten
years
but
they
had
not
been
blessed
with
a
child
ofttimes
ada
would
sit
in
her
room
and
weep
she
prayed
every
day
to
god
to
fulfil
her
desire
by
giving
her
a
son
or
a
daughter
abraham
did
his
best
to
comfort
her
by
telling
her
that
all
would
come
right
in
time
nevertheless
he
felt
very
sad
when
he
came
home
and
thought
of
the
future
he
would
have
given
anything
to
have
had
a
little
son
who
might
be
taught
the
holy
religion
which
he
loved
so
well

neighbours
in
their
street
were
none
too
kind
and
they
slighted
ada
this
made
her
grief
more
bitter
did
not
the
people
often
say
in
abrahams
hearing
that
children
are
a
token
of
gods
blessing
was
it
not
true
that
the
house
which
lacked
the
merry
laughter
of
little
innocent
children
was
under
a
curse
or
spell
did
not
the
holy
law
teach
that
it
was
a
religious
duty
to
marry
and
to
have
children
would
it
not
be
better
he
argued
with
himself
to
divorce
his
wife
if
after
being
married
for
ten
years
she
had
no
child
she
might
marry
another
man
and
have
children
and
so
find
her
happiness
all
these
thoughts
flashed
again
and
again
through
his
mind
at
last
when
the
anniversary
of
their
tenth
marriage
day
arrived
abraham
said
to
his
wife
let
us
visit
today
our
true
friend
rabbi
simeon
the
son
of
jochai
when
they
came
before
the
famous
master
abraham
with
tears
in
his
eyes
said
o
good
rabbi
my
dear
wife
has
been
faithful
to
me
and
loving
during
the
past
ten
years
it
has
pleased
our
heavenly
father
to
withhold
from
us
the
blessing
of
children
i
fear
this
is
on
account
of
my
many
sins
it
seems
to
me
that
our
home
henceforth
will
not
be
as
happy
as
it
should
be
my
wife
grieves
over
her
barrenness
and
i
fret
because
she
is
unhappy
is
it
not
my
duty
to
set
her
free
whilst
abraham
was
speaking
his
wife
wept
she
knew
that
if
he
sent
her
away
from
his
heart
and
home
her
life
would
be
utterly
miserable
and
unendurable
her
genuine
sorrow
touched
the
heart
of
her
husband
who
turned
to
her
and
exclaimed
my
dear
and
sweet
wife
be
calm
and
do
not
grieve
for
we
must
ever
submit
to
the
will
of
providence
do
not
think
that
i
am
not
ofttimes
sad
because
we
have
no
child
to
cheer
your
long
days
if
i
could
only
give
you
some
substitute
i
would
most
gladly
do
so
listen
dearest
i
now
faithfully
promise
to
allow
you
to
choose
whatever
you
like
best
in
our
home
and
you
may
take
it
with
you
to
your
fathers
house
as
a
keepsake
when
you
leave
me
for
good
this
will
always
be
a
visible
token
of
the
deep
affection
and
true
love
which
united
us
during
the
past
ten
years
the
rabbi
watched
his
guests
with
sympathetic
eyes
he
knew
that
abraham
had
made
up
his
mind
to
divorce
his
worthy
wife
nothing
would
make
him
waver
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
farseeing
eye
he
began
to
address
them
saying
my
dear
children
i
can
only
pity
you
for
i
am
deeply
grieved
to
see
how
you
are
about
to
lose
one
another
before
you
finally
part
however
let
me
advise
you
to
invite
this
day
your
good
friends
to
a
farewell
banquet
even
as
they
gathered
around
you
ten
years
ago
at
your
marriage
feast
love
united
you
and
in
love
prepare
to
separate
if
it
must
be
the
wise
master
was
in
hopes
that
all
the
old
ties
would
be
revived
by
the
presence
of
the
family
circle
of
friends
and
that
love
would
still
hold
them
together
abraham
and
ada
promised
to
follow
the
advice
of
the
rabbi
and
they
returned
home
ada
at
once
sent
to
all
their
friends
and
provided
a
most
liberal
banquet
her
husband
sat
beside
her
as
usual
and
she
took
care
that
his
wineglass
was
constantly
refilled
good
cheer
made
the
company
very
happy
and
abraham
determined
to
spend
a
jolly
evening
for
the
last
time
in
the
company
of
his
wife
whom
he
really
loved
ada
had
carefully
prepared
her
plans
her
husband
had
toasted
each
of
his
guests
and
soon
the
excellent
wine
which
he
drank
sent
him
into
a
deep
sleep
without
a
moments
delay
ada
beckoned
to
her
servants
to
come
to
her
she
told
them
to
lift
up
the
armchair
in
which
her
husband
sat
asleep
and
to
carry
it
at
once
to
her
fathers
house
in
a
neighbouring
street
the
company
looked
on
in
surprise
and
guessing
the
meaning
of
what
they
saw
they
took
their
departure
meanwhile
abraham
fast
asleep
had
been
carried
to
his
new
quarters
he
was
put
in
a
beautiful
room
with
ada
at
his
side
waiting
for
him
to
awaken
at
dawn
the
effect
of
the
wine
began
to
wear
off
and
he
awoke
looking
around
with
great
surprise
he
exclaimed
where
am
i
ada
took
his
hand
and
stroking
it
gently
she
said
to
him
my
beloved
you
are
in
my
fathers
house
what
am
i
doing
here
he
cries
you
are
just
waking
up
she
says
you
remember
when
we
yesterday
visited
rabbi
simeon
the
son
of
jochai
you
faithfully
promised
me
that
i
might
choose
anything
i
liked
best
in
our
home
and
take
it
with
me
when
i
left
your
roof
last
night
i
left
your
house
and
i
took
you
with
me
as
there
was
nothing
in
your
home
or
for
the
matter
of
that
in
all
the
world
so
precious
to
me
as
your
dear
self
you
were
the
choicest
possession
in
our
old
home
and
you
are
mine
now
and
for
ever
you
have
by
your
promise
to
me
given
yourself
over
to
me
divorce
or
no
divorce
you
are
my
property
for
i
know
very
well
you
always
keep
your
promise
abraham
saw
the
humour
of
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
and
laughed
again
and
again
at
the
huge
joke
his
clever
wife
had
perpetrated
at
his
expense
well
done
he
exclaimed
we
are
now
agreed
that
the
question
of
divorce
is
solved
once
again
are
we
united
and
this
time
for
ever
nothing
shall
part
us
as
long
as
we
live
like
all
good
people
they
lived
a
very
happy
life
in
time
a
son
was
born
and
later
on
a
daughter
was
given
to
them
and
they
all
rejoiced
in
one
anothers
happiness
yalu
genesis
the
coins
of
elijah
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
really
pious
man
who
was
ever
ready
to
assist
all
who
needed
his
help
prosperity
and
happiness
smiled
upon
him
year
in
and
year
out
all
went
well
with
him
and
his
dear
ones
all
of
a
sudden
a
change
took
place
the
business
which
he
carried
on
proved
to
be
gradually
showing
a
loss
instead
of
the
former
profit
trade
began
to
dwindle
the
regular
customers
died
or
moved
away
bad
debts
increased
and
eventually
the
entire
fortune
of
the
good
man
was
lost
in
order
to
provide
for
the
daily
needs
of
his
wife
and
children
he
worked
in
the
fields
as
a
labourer
paid
by
the
day
the
days
work
was
long
and
hard
but
a
good
heart
and
a
willing
spirit
enabled
him
to
overcome
all
difficulties
he
even
spared
a
coin
of
his
wages
to
help
those
in
a
worse
plight
than
he
found
himself
now
it
happened
one
day
whilst
he
was
engaged
in
ploughing
a
field
that
a
stranger
approached
and
greeted
him
saying
peace
be
to
thee
and
to
all
thy
house
he
replied
peace
be
also
to
thee
and
thine
the
stranger
then
continued
friend
i
come
to
tell
thee
that
thou
art
destined
to
regain
thy
fortune
and
to
live
in
affluence
for
a
period
of
six
years
during
thy
life
here
on
earth
it
is
thine
to
choose
when
this
period
shall
begin
shall
it
be
now
or
later
in
life
astonished
at
the
strange
words
which
he
had
heard
the
labourer
looked
at
his
companion
to
see
if
he
was
dreaming
good
stranger
he
cried
art
thou
a
prophet
or
a
magician
that
thou
speakest
in
this
wise
i
fear
thou
art
a
poor
man
even
as
i
am
go
thy
way
in
peace
for
i
cannot
help
thee
today
for
i
am
penniless
at
the
moment
i
should
be
happy
to
give
thee
a
fee
for
thy
happy
forecast
but
i
cannot
give
what
i
have
not
got
go
in
peace
and
may
heaven
send
thee
help
the
stranger
went
away
and
the
labourer
resumed
his
work
without
thinking
any
more
of
the
strange
conversation
which
he
had
just
had
after
a
short
interval
the
stranger
returned
and
repeated
the
offer
only
to
be
refused
when
however
for
the
third
time
he
urged
the
unwilling
labourer
to
accept
his
gift
by
believing
in
the
proffered
promise
the
poor
toiler
weary
of
his
hard
daily
struggle
in
the
fields
at
last
consented
to
consult
his
wife
before
coming
to
a
decision
a
glimmer
of
hope
in
the
possibility
of
the
promise
had
arisen
in
his
heart
perhaps
after
all
he
thought
kind
providence
has
sent
this
messenger
to
help
me
in
my
dire
distress
and
that
now
the
poverty
which
has
harassed
me
and
my
dear
ones
will
be
replaced
by
wealth
and
prosperity
he
ran
home
as
quickly
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
and
told
his
wife
all
that
had
transpired
he
emphasized
the
insistence
displayed
by
the
stranger
he
said
to
his
wife
assuming
that
the
stranger
is
speaking
the
truth
and
that
i
am
to
be
rich
for
a
period
of
six
years
when
do
you
advise
me
to
choose
our
time
of
prosperitynow
or
later
in
life
after
a
moments
consideration
she
cried
now
now
her
husband
returned
to
the
field
without
further
delay
and
found
the
stranger
awaiting
his
decision
when
the
labourer
told
him
his
wish
to
enjoy
there
and
then
the
promised
wealth
and
prosperity
the
stranger
opened
his
purse
and
took
out
two
pieces
of
silver
here
my
friend
he
said
take
these
two
coins
and
return
them
to
me
six
years
hence
when
i
shall
call
on
thee
do
not
forget
i
shall
require
my
money
to
be
restored
to
me
when
i
come
to
demand
it
after
the
labourer
had
taken
the
coins
he
thanked
his
benefactor
and
promised
to
return
the
gift
as
arranged
in
a
second
the
stranger
had
disappeared
no
trace
of
the
direction
he
had
taken
was
discerned
by
the
labourer
who
also
recalled
the
fact
that
the
stranger
had
come
upon
him
all
of
a
sudden
very
strange
he
said
there
is
some
mystery
about
this
stranger
he
seems
to
come
from
nowhere
and
to
return
to
the
same
place
no
sooner
had
the
labourer
placed
the
silver
coins
in
his
pocket
than
he
perceived
a
sudden
change
coming
over
him
he
no
longer
felt
the
same
man
his
poverty
and
sorrow
fled
away
from
him
and
a
new
feeling
of
contentment
and
security
arose
in
his
heart
he
bowed
his
head
in
gratitude
and
thanked
god
for
his
manifold
mercies
meanwhile
wonderful
events
were
occurring
in
his
home
his
eldest
son
was
turning
the
soil
in
the
garden
at
the
back
of
their
house
when
he
saw
gold
glittering
in
the
sunlight
he
dug
deeper
and
deeper
and
continued
to
find
the
precious
metal
in
fact
there
was
evidently
a
treasure
which
had
been
lying
hidden
there
all
the
years
of
their
poverty
the
young
man
cried
aloud
in
his
joy
his
mother
and
her
other
sons
came
to
see
what
was
amiss
as
soon
as
she
saw
what
was
happening
she
sent
her
youngest
son
to
his
father
she
said
do
not
fail
to
tell
him
that
god
has
given
us
back
our
fortune
before
the
door
of
their
house
however
stood
the
father
in
a
moment
he
was
with
his
wife
and
children
and
uniting
with
them
gave
thanks
to
him
who
giveth
and
taketh
away
the
pious
man
and
his
virtuous
wife
resolved
to
make
good
use
of
their
wealth
as
long
as
it
was
entrusted
to
their
care
they
were
very
happy
because
they
were
now
in
a
position
to
help
the
poor
who
so
sorely
needed
their
assistance
the
wife
said
to
her
good
husband
my
dear
we
must
not
forget
that
our
prosperity
will
not
last
for
ever
we
are
to
be
rich
for
six
years
only
let
us
during
this
period
feed
the
hungry
clothe

before

in
charity

the
fox
and
the
raven
one
fine
day
a
raven
found
a
nice
piece
of
fresh
cheese
which
he
carried
away
to
a
favourite
resting
place
on
the
leafy
branch
of
a
beautiful
figtree
believing
himself
to
be
out
of
harms
way
he
was
about
to
eat
and
enjoy
his
booty
when
he
heard
a
wellknown
voice
softly
calling
to
him
good
day
dear
friend
raven
whence
did
the
voice
come
lo
and
behold
at
the
foot
of
the
figtree
stood
master
fox
eyeing
with
a
greedy
look
the
raven
and
the
cheese
how
to
obtain
the
latter
was
the
thought
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
the
crafty
fox
being
unable
to
climb
the
tree
he
resolved
to
trick
the
raven
so
as
to
make
him
drop
the
cheese
again
master
fox
cried
good
day
dear
friend
raven
thou
art
verily
the
most
beautiful
of
birds
if
all
the
winged
creatures
beneath
the
heavens
were
gathered
around
thee
thou
wouldst
easily
excel
them
all
by
reason
of
thy
lovely
feathers
moreover
if
thou
wouldst
only
sing
then
would
thy
song
surpass
the
sweetest
melody
of
any
other
of
thy
winged
companions
and
thou
wouldst
become
king
of
the
birds
the
sweet
words
sank
deeply
into
the
ravens
heart
and
he
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
attaining
to
such
undreamtof
greatness
all
that
he
had
to
do
was
merely
to
sing
excited
with
joy
and
pride
he
quickly
opened
his
mouth
and
raising
his
voice
he
tried
to
sing
alas
he
only
croaked
meanwhile
the
cheese
fell
from
his
mouth
to
the
ground
the
greedy
fox
pounced
upon
the
prey
and
with
a
joyful
cry
he
said
dear
friend
raven
never
again
will
i
listen
to
the
voice
of
other
sweet
singers
after
hearing
thy
beautiful
voice
pray
excuse
me
if
i
hasten
away
to
finish
the
cheese
thou
hast
so
generously
given
me
as
a
reward
for
my
flattery
great
indeed
must
be
the
power
of
pride
since
it
overcomes
the
desires
of
thy
appetite
