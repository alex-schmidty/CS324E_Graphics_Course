extract_words.py:
-created by Alex Schmidt
-This Python file extracts each word from a file called novel.txt and creates uniquewords.txt which contains
 a list of every unique word and wordfrequency.txt which sorts the words by the number of times they were used
 and counts the number of words in each frequency category.

a3_novelvisualization Processing file:
-created by Zach Marx
-When this program is run and while its canvas is clicked, a random set of the words from uniquewords.txt
 are displayed on screen and color coated based on the first letter of that word.

a3_wordfrequency Processing file:
-created by Jeremiah Johnson
-This program takes our text file of frequencies and creates a PI Chart to visualize the proportions between them. 
 You are able to hover the mouse over sections of the chart in order to see the percentage of the total that section uses up.
